# Modeling framework for dynamic metabolic modeling of ecosystems

This modeling framework integrates Ordinary Differential Equation models with
constraint-based metabolic network models, using various Flux Balance Analysis functionalities 
implemented in COBRApy. *The code is made available under the GNU General Public License (see LICENSE) at no warranty*
and is under further development at [https://gitlab.com/asuccurro/dfba-ode-framework](https://gitlab.com/asuccurro/dfba-ode-framework).

This corresponds to the version v1.0, used for simulating Escherichia coli sub-population dynamics in the work "Emerging sub-population dynamics uncovered with a community model of Escherichia coli diauxic growth" by Succurro, Segrè, Ebenhöh, 2018.
